# Encapsulation in C# 

This repository explains the concept of Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming using C#.
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP and is used to protect data from direct access.

## What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit called a class.
It helps in data hiding and improves security and maintainability of code.

In C#, Encapsulation is achieved using:
- Access modifiers (private, public)
- Properties (get and set)

## Why Encapsulation is Important
- Protects data from unauthorized access
- Improves code security
- Makes code easier to maintain
- Controls how data is accessed or modified

## Code Examples
This repository contains three C# examples:
1. Basic Encapsulation
2. Encapsulation using Properties
3. Data Hiding with private variables

## Language Used
- C#
