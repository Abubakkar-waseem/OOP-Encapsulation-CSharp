# Encapsulation in C#

This repository explains the concept of **Encapsulation** in Object-Oriented Programming using C#.  
Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP and is used to **protect data** from direct access and modification.

## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation means **wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit** called a class.  
It helps in **data hiding**, improves security, and makes code easier to maintain.

In C#, Encapsulation is achieved using:
- **Access modifiers** (`private`, `public`)  
- **Properties** (`get` and `set`)

## Why Encapsulation is Important

- Protects data from unauthorized access  
- Improves code security  
- Makes code easier to maintain  
- Controls how data is accessed or modified

## Code Examples

This repository contains **three C# examples** demonstrating encapsulation:  
1. Basic Encapsulation  
2. Encapsulation Using Properties  
3. Data Hiding with Private Variables  

All code files are available in the **`Examples/` folder**.
